## üöÄ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

To get started, make sure you have MySQL installed and running on your system.
Create a database named `hoteldatabase` and then execute the provided `commands_&_Data_Input.sql` file to create the necessary tables and insert initial data.

After setting up the database, update the database authentication details in the Python code wherever the MySQL connection is defined (such as in the `get_connection()` function). Replace the host, port, user, password, and database fields with your own MySQL credentials to ensure the application connects properly.
